#Notifier
Hi, users.
This application is for all those who would love to get the notification whenever a new movie releases or whenever the bookings for the move at your nearest multiplex  has opened or not.

How to use it:

1) Run the notify.exe file.
2) Enter the url of any movie booking site which contains the name of the movie in that page or the names of the available multiplexes in the web page
3) Enter the name of the movie or the multiplex name
4) click the notify button and relax.

Whenever the movie releases or the booking at your nearest multiplex has opened you will automatically get the notification in the form of a pop up window.

While the process runs you need to minimise it and kindly be careful don't close it.
First the window may be not responding but once you click then you would be able to minimise it.
So don't panic if the window becomes not responding..

All the best.!!!
